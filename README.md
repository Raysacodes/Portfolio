# Raysa Alvarez Portfolio

A multi-page responsive portfolio website for Raysa Alvarez which is built with css.
For this challenge I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be added to over time to become my own personal portfolio of work. I used what I have learned in the first two weeks of the bootcamp to write the HTML and CSS from scratch, while keeping in mind the following requirements:


* Site is divided into several sections, including About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
* I included functioning navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections
* I included a recent photo of myself.
* The non-placholder applications will take the user to the deployed application on my GitHub when clicked on.
* The page was styled for multiple screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones.
* I also included some on hover effects for the various links and the projects on the page.
